Spatially-Enhanced Transformer for For Robot-Action Personalization


In order for an accurate and reliable personal assistance robot, the robot must be able to adapt to the specifications of the individuals it is serving. Personalization, can be brought by having the user provide a few examples of specific object and receptacle placements. As brought forth by [1], Large Language Model Summarization techniques can be used to summarize these placements and infer new placements for unseen objects. This allows for a placement algorithm that is personalized to the user. However, struggles with the quality of summarization hinder the accuracy of placement to object mappings. I propose a spatially-enhanced transformer architecture to enhance the summarization of user preferences.
